# Telegra.ph API

An API endpoint that takes a [telegra.ph](http://telegra.ph) link and returns the data at that link as JSON.

The main reason this exists is because I'd like to be able to write 'blog posts' through an interface like Telegra.ph's without hosting the data myself and being able to display it on any custom client I'd like.
